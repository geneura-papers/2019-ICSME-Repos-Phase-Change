\begin{abstract}
  Software nowadays is almost exclusively developed using source
  control systems. Traditionally, the study of the evolution of this
  type of systems is usually done from the perspective of
  self-organized complex systems, since the version-control tools used
  allow a community-oriented development without a fixed or appointed
  leader. Understanding if and how a software development team
  self-organizes might give hints on how to improve productivity,
  reduce bugs or, in the case of open source systems based on
  volunteer woor, reduce churn and increase engagement.

  However, one of the essential characteristics needed to understand
  this type of systems' behaviour and to know if we are truly dealing
  with an auto-organized community is the appearance or not of a power
  law in the events' size distributions.  In this case, we have chosen
  to treat commits as our events, that is, additions to the code by
  users.
  % - This is our choice and should be presented that way. Other
  % people might use a different thing, like file size, author
  % interactions or whatever - JJ

  But we have to be extremely cautious with this kind of approach,
  because the existence or not of this type of distributions should be
  always analyzed mathematically to minimize posible sources of bias.
  We will use the concept of hypothesis tests for that purpose, that
  is, checking what is the likelihood that our data follows a power
  law distribution instead of some other with similar characteristics.

  The conclusions of these tests may not shed light on whether we are
  in a state of self-organization.  Software development is a process
  that evolves over time and analysis at a specific moment is not
  significant.  Our approach in this work uses a temporal analysis
  over the evolution of commit's distribution in software
  projects. For that, we have selected a set of repositories that
  exhibit singular behaviors such as a large number of contributions
  versus few or inconclusive results in statistical tests.

  Our study seeks to provide conclusive evidence about the state of
  the chosen repositories, answering wether they have not reached a
  state of self-organization in all its evolution (that is, never
  present power law distributions) or, if they have done so, but due
  to other code insertions and to the temporary nature of the creative
  process, this self-organized state has been altered.
